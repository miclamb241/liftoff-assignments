## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
We are building a restaurant review application where people can find out info about restaurants in their area. 
They will also be able to view and submit reviews for restaurants. Additionally people (including restaurant owners) 
can submit new restaurants to the site to enable it to continue to grow.
This site will give people a quick way to learn about restaurant options in their area. Additionally, having access to 
other customer reviews will help them in making the most informed decision about where they want to eat.

### Features
User logon: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Create listing: Users will be able to create new restaurant pages that other users can view.
Post reviews: Users will be able to post reviews for restaurants that other users can view.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
SQL
Thymeleaf
JavaScript (Angular?)
CSS

### What I'll Have to Learn
How to attach the reviewerâ€™s user id to each of their reviews so only they can modify them (and so other users can see
all their reviews ideally).
How to integrate Google Maps API (stretch goal).
